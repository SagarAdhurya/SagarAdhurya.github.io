                    <p>
                        Hello, I am <strong>Dr. Sagar Adhurya</strong>, an <strong>Assistant Professor in Zoology</strong> at the Government General Degree College, Mangalkote, West Bengal. With a PhD in Zoology from Visva-Bharati University, and postdoctoral research experience at Kyung Hee University (South Korea) and IISER Kolkata, I specialize in <strong>ecological modelling, biodiversity informatics, and conservation biology</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My research integrates <strong>process-based ecological modelling, machine learning algorithms, and biodiversity assessments</strong> to better understand freshwater ecosystems, food web dynamics, and species conservation. I am deeply committed to bridging theoretical ecology with practical conservation applications, which has been recognized through awards such as the <em>International Society for Ecological Modelling's Best Young Researcher Award</em> and a <em>WWF-India Conservation Catalyst Grant</em> for Indian Grey Wolf conservation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond research and teaching, I actively contribute to community and citizen science initiatives such as the Biodiversity of West Bengal Database and serve in various leadership roles in academic and conservation societies. My passions also extend to <strong>wildlife photography, birdwatching, animal call recording, and trekking</strong>, which enrich my scientific perspective and outreach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This website presents my academic journey, research outputs, conservation projects, and teaching philosophy to inspire collaborations and foster a deeper understanding of ecology and biodiversity.
                    </p>
