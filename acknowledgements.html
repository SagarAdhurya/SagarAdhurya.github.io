                I am deeply grateful to Prof. Santanu Ray, my PhD supervisor, whose constant encouragement inspired me to strive for excellence and whose guidance helped me navigate important decisions in life. His wisdom extended far beyond research, and he has always been available whenever I sought his counsel. His mentorship has profoundly shaped both my professional and personal growth, and I consider myself truly fortunate to have had such an extraordinary guide. He is the reason I entered the field of ecological modelling, and under his supervision, the foundations of my research career were built.

                I owe special thanks to Prof. Young-Seuk Park, my Korean postdoctoral supervisor, who turned my dream of pursuing a foreign postdoc into reality. In my 14 months with him, I gained not only profound knowledge in ecological modelling and informatics but also the privilege of knowing a remarkable human being. In a country where I had no one, he became my guardian, caring for me far beyond academic guidance. He believed in holistic development ‚Äî nurturing my physical and mental well-being, fostering a positive lab environment, encouraging my hobbies, and guiding my future. I will always remember the countless hours he devoted to preparing me for job interviews, and the day he drove for hours to bid me farewell as I returned to India. His words ‚Äî that he would continue to guide me even from afar ‚Äî remain true, for he still does, despite the distance.
