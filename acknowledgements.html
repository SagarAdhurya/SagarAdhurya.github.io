                My heartfelt gratitude to Dr. Utpal Singha Roy, my college teacher, who introduced me to the fascinating world of research and guided me throughout my career. His early mentorship laid the foundation for my research journey and instilled in me a deep passion for scientific inquiry.

                I owe special thanks to Prof. Young-Seuk Park, my Korean postdoctoral supervisor, who turned my dream of pursuing a foreign postdoc into reality. During my tenure of just 14 months, I gained not only profound knowledge in ecological modelling and informatics but also the privilege of knowing a remarkable human being. In a country where I had no one, he became my guardian, taking care of me beyond academic guidance. He was not merely a postdoctoral mentor; he believed in holistic development ‚Äî nurturing my physical and mental well-being, fostering a positive lab environment, encouraging my hobbies, and guiding my future. I will never forget the countless hours he spent coaching me on how to excel in job interviews, or the day he drove for hours to bid me farewell as I returned to India. His words ‚Äî that he would continue to guide me even from afar ‚Äî remain true, for he still does, despite the distance.

In my brief tenure at IISER, I consider myself fortunate to have met a mentor like her ‚Äî someone who is not only an exceptional guide but also a wonderful human being.
